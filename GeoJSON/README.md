The Census Bureau publishes both high and low accuracy geographic area files to accommodate the
widest possible variety of user needs (within feasibility). Cartography Files are simplified
representations of selected geographic areas from the Census Bureau’s Master Address
File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) system. _These
boundary files are specifically designed for small scale thematic mapping (i.e., for
visualizations)_.

For a while now, we have published our cartography files in the [`.shp`] format. More recently, we
expanded our portfolio of available formats to [`.kml`]. It is with this release that we follow suit
with the community at large to release these boundaries in `.json` (GeoJSON) format.

### Geographies Available by Vintage

The most comprehensive set of geographies and vintages can be found within the [500k set]. Some
vintages - [`103` through `110`] - are references to sessions of Congress and only contain a single
geographic summary level: `"congressional district"` The following tables represent the availability
of various geographic summary levels through the remaining vintages:
